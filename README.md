# About Me and the Book

Hi, my name is [Å½eljko Filipin][zeljko]. I am software tester, [Watir][watir] community manager and host of [Watir Podcast][watirpodcast]. This is a book on Watir. It is not finished. In fact, I have just started with it, and then life happened. I hope I will have some time to work on in the near future.

Book source is at [github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook][github], web page is at [watir.com/book][web] and there is also a Google group at [groups.google.com/group/watirbook][google].
