# Pop Ups

There are a lot of popups that Watir users need to deal with. The last time I have checked, there was 11 different pop ups we know about. Some of them Watir can handle with ease, some not. In this chapter you will learn what to do when you see a pop up.

# Reference

In this chapter I will do my best to summarize the book.

## Watir RDoc

I am not sure about this chapter. I could be too verbose.

# Learning More

After you know the basics, you will want to learn more. This chapter will show you the way.

## Watir

If you want to learn more Watir, there are a lot of resources. Unfortunately, they are not easy to find. In this chapter I will list all resources I know about, including Watir web site and wiki, Watir related articles, blogs and podcast. There is even custom Google search engine that searches all Watir related sites, but nothing more.

## Ruby

If you want to learn more Ruby, there are plenty of resources. Books, articles, blogs... In this chapter I will make a few suggestions where to start.

# Develop Watir

If you are need to fix a bug or implement a feature, Watir can easily be extended. In this chapter you will learn how to do it. After all, that is what open source is all about. You will learn how to get Watir source code, run unit tests, build and install Watir gems, install development gems, how to contribute code and a few more tricks.

# Community

Contributing code is not the only way you can help. You can answer Watir related questions at Stack Overflow, Google Groups or IRC channel, submit bugs, fix, update or create documentation, to name a few.

# Tools

You need tools to help you test. You already know about Ruby, IRB and Watir. In this chapter I will talk about browser extensions, text editors and IDEs and everything else that will make you life easier.

# Frameworks
## Test Unit
## RSpec
## WatirCraft
## Taza

# Other Tools for Testing Web Applications

In this chapter I will briefly mention other tools that can be used to test web applications.
